# TO-DO-App
I created The TO-DO App is a simple web application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Users can add new tasks, view the list of current tasks, and delete tasks once they are completed. This app provides a basic user interface and interaction using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
